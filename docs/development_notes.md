# Development Notes

The current repository snapshot only contains the architectural outline and does not include the actual Next.js/Tailwind
application referenced in the feature requests. Because the runtime codebase is absent, the bugs involving streak sharing,
log creation, dashboard widgets, the explore tab, and the profile layout cannot be reproduced or patched at this time.

Please add the project sources (pages, components, API handlers, styles, etc.) so that the fixes can be implemented.
